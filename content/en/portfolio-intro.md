Title: Portoflio intro
Description: A quick history of my web developper journey
---

**I built my first website in 2016** for a 3D printing University project. Since then I built and managed **several websites** for local and international projects: a B2B massage therapy and ostheopathie service, a pancakes catering project, a local bowling in Colombia and a local plastic recycling community in Montréal.

In 2020, **I co-founded the first online farmer's market in Montréal**: [Panier Québécois](https://panierquebecois.ca). I have been developping, improving and maintaining our website ever since (along managing our business' startegy, marketing and operations with my lovely co-founders).

As our business doesn't require a full-time developper anymore, I am now putting my experience in web development, entrepreneurship and marketing to good use: **helping you build your online presence!**
