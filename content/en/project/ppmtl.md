Precious Plastic Montréal is a non-for-profit that **makes local small scale plastic recycling possible**. Based on a Danish open-source project, PPMTL builds machines to shred and **remelt plastic into new objects**.

After helping to build a few of the machines myself, I got to work on the website. The goal of the web platform is to showcase the community's work and help find new talent.
