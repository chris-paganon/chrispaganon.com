Title: Precious Plastic Montréal
Description: Local small scale recycling non-for-profit
---

Precious Plastic Montréal is a non-for-profit that makes local small scale plastic recycling possible. Based on a Danish open-source project, PPMTL builds machines to shred and remelt plastic into new objects.

After helping to build a few of the machines myself, I got to work on the website. The goal of the web platform is to showcase the community's work and help find new talent.
