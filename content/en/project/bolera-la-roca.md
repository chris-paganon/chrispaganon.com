Bolera La Roca is a **local bowling in Bogota, Colombia**. In addition to their traditional food offering they also started a sushi delivery service during the pandemic.

The website is both a store front for the bowling and a platform to **order sushi online**. It requires to enable orders only in a certain zone and during opening hours. It also features a wide selection of products ready to order.

The team has **access to the backend** to make changes to the website design as well as the food offering. I offered training on the platform's backend to give them as much **autonomy** as they need.
