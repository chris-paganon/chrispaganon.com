Title: Portoflio intro
Description: A quick history of my web developper journey
---

FRFR I built my first website in 2016 for a 3D printing University project. Since then I built and managed several websites for local and international projects: a crepes catering project, a B2B massage therapy and ostheopathie service, a local bowling in Colombia and a small-scale plastic recycling community in Montréal.

In 2020, I co-founded the first online farmer's market in Montréal: Panier Québécois. I have been developping, improving and maintaining our website ever since (along managing our business' startegy, marketing and operations with my lovely co-founders).

As our business doesn't require a full-time developper anymore, I am now putting my experience in web development, entrepreneurship and marketing to good use: helping you build your online presence!
